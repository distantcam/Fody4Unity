# Fody4Unity

Pretty bare bones for now. Needs work to get up and running.

In your Assets folder put the following files.

    Assets
    `-- Fody
        `-- Editor
            |-- bin
            |   |-- Fody4Unity.exe
            |   |-- FodyCommon.dll
            |   |-- FodyIsolated.dll
            |   |-- Mono.Cecil.dll
            |   |-- Mono.Cecil.Mdb.dll
            |   |-- Mono.Cecil.Pdb.dll
            |   `-- Mono.Cecil.Rocks.dll
            `-- Fody4Unity.Scripts.dll
